To Use:
 - create an HTML 5 canvas
   ie. <canvas id="canvas"> </canvas>
 - in your javascript do the following;
   var canvas = new HTML5Draw("canvas");
 - Congratulations! your canvas is now ready to be drawn on. Just click and drag.

Set functions:
 - You can set the color by using the function HTML5Draw.mainAction.setColor( color ). Where   color is a string representation of an rgba color
   ie. HTML5Draw.mainAction.setColor("rgba(0,0,0,0.1)");
 - You can set the size of your paintbrush by using the function HTML5Draw.mainAction.setSize( size ). Where size is an integer value in pixels.
   ie. HTMLDraw.mainAction.setSize(3);
 - Lastly you can set paint-bucket on and off with the function HTML5Draw.mainAction.togglePaintBucket().
